# Week 1A: Course Introduction
Welcome to the course!

## Overview
Welcome to IGME-230 Web Site Design & Implementation! There is more to this course than the title implies, as we will be learning a lot more than just the design and implementation of static web sites. 
Hopefully the skills you acquire in the class will help you to get a co-op position, and give you the skills you need to create "passion pieces" for your professional portfolio.

## What this course is about
Official description from SIS: *This course provides an introduction to web development tools and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and DHTML, AJAX, web platforms and environments, and server-side programming methods.*
We will:
* review basic web publishing (HTML/CSS/FTP) and HTML validation
* learn how a web server works and how to do basic scripting of it
* expose you to the PHP scripting language that runs on most web servers
* explore advanced CSS layout utilizing the CSS box model and the latest specifications
* go beyond *type*, *class*, and *id* CSS selectors by utilizing advanced CSS 3 selectors
* construct **web applications**. A web app is a client–server software application in which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser. Examples of web apps you might use are github.com, Gmail, and Google Drive. Web App assignments we will complete in class include interactive calculators, a functional "To do" app, an app that allows the user to search for and view animated GIFs, and an app that allows the user to search the iTunes store for songs, and then listen to previews
* construct **interactive games** that run in the web browser (these are also considered to be web applications):
  * utilizing the DOM (Document Object Model) we will build an interactive concentration game, and a typing game. These games will rely heavily on CSS 3 features such as CSS transformations (rotate & skew), and CSS keyframed animations
  * utilizing the Pixi.js rendering framework, we will build sprite-based games such as simple shooters and top-down adventure games.
* learn how to add advanced interactivity to web pages. Building web apps and web games requires knowledge of more than just HTML & CSS, but also of the JavaScript programming language that runs in all web browsers. We will be covering the current "standard" version of JavaScript known as ES5 (ECMAScript 5), as well as some of the well-supported and powerful features of ES6 (AKA ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015)
* utilize a CSS framework such as Bootstrap to construct a responsive web portfolio
When the course is complete, you will hopefully have at least the beginnings of a "portfolio piece" or two that you will be able to show to prospective employers.
  
## Topics
This week and next we will:
* discuss what this course is about and where it fits in the GDD curriculum
* point you to IGME-110 resources you may need to review
* discuss what a web server is (and does)
* discuss the HTTP protocol and see it how it works
* learn how to script certain web server behavior by utilizing .htaccess files

## Prerequisites

Students in this class should have a basic working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and publishing to RIT's web hosting environment (people.rit.edu). This material was covered in IGME-110. You can review much of that material here: [IIM-Web-Review/](../IIM-Web-Review)

If you need to brush up on your HTML and CSS skills, I recommend using the CodeAcademy tutorials that we currently use in IGME-110: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web, lessons 1-5. We will be doing a very brief review, but you shouldn't expect to rely on that to cover all of the prerequisite knowledge.

You will also need a GitHub account, and the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) so that you can create and access private repos.

If you have questions between now and the start of class, feel free to send me an email! 

## Discussion
This course is not focused on "web design", but instead on developing highly interactive web applications and web games that heavily utilize the JavScript programming language.  The major topics of this course are split roughly into thirds:
- web publishing (HTML/CSS) both "from scratch" as well as with the Bootstrap CSS framework
- web application development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript & a little PHP)
- web game development (JavaScript & the Pixi.js rendering engine)

Once you complete this course you should be able to do the following:
- publish a "traditional" multi-page website to the WWW. The content will be properly "chunked" and the site navigation will be intuitive and easy to use.
- publish a single-page application (SPA) web site portfolio. You can see an example here: http://dougwatro.com - this example has eight distinct "pages" of content that are presented on a single web page.
- code a web application that can connect to web services, and download/display their data. Examples inlcude a music searching and previewing applications that use the iTunes API, and a GIF viewing application that utilizes the Giphy API.
- code a DOM web game that uses HTML/CSS for the User Interface, and JavaScript for game logic & interactivity. Examples include card games and typing games.
- code a sprite-based game such as a shooter or platformer utilizing JavaScript and Pixi.js 

## Projects and other stuff for inspiration
There are a lot of reasons to improve your web development skills. Think about how much you use the Web every day, and how integrated it is into the games and new media fields. Games on the Web are pretty big right now. Also, it's a fantastic medium for showing off your work to the world, including potential employers!

## Homework
Get a GitHub account (if you don't have one already), and go through the tutorial above. 
Before next class, set up a folder *for this course* in your account, named *IGME230* or something similar, and put a link to it in the myCourses "GitHub Accounts" discussion. This should be a public repository (otherwise the link won't work).
