# Capstone Project - Web Portfolio
## Description
You will create a personal portfolio site to showcase your work to potential employers and/or customers. The site must include examples of your work, contact information, and your resume. The examples should include at least three different things you've created; those could be projects or exercises from this or other classes, or work you've done on your own. An effective portfolio will highlight your *best work*, and that work should correlates to your career goals. 

Here are some example portfolios that were created by IGM students:

- [http://dougwatro.com (utilized Bootstrap)](http://dougwatro.com)

Some other examples are here:

- https://onepagelove.com

## Content Requirements
- the page is named index.html
- the page will have a navigation system to allow the user to quickly access distinct content
- it will include your name and an image (could be a photo or an avatar)
- Gallery page with brief information about each of your work examples (examples can be projects or exercises from this class or other classes, or work you've done on your own)
- Individual pages with more detail for each of your examples
    - each example needs a title, an image (could be a screenshot or photo), and a one-paragraph description that highlights the tools you used and the skills that it illustrates
    - if the example is from a group project, be sure to clearly indicate what your role was on the project
- Contact information page
- Resume (HTML, not PDF) that also has a printer-friendly stylesheet
- Notes page with information about how you made the site, including the following content: 
  - Source information for any images or code that you didn't create yourself (including CSS frameworks, typefaces, and any code libraries)
  - If you used a CSS framework, explain how you modified it so that your portfolio doesn't look exactly like every other site that uses that framework. 
  - What you did to go beyond the base expectations for the project--what did you do that was particularly challenging? This could involve art/design, content, or code. 
  - Must be called notes.html and placed in the portfolio directory, but linking to it from the portfolio navitation is not required (see the Submission & Due Dates section below)

## Design Requirements
- the site is a [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), [single-page design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
- It must have a minimum of two layouts--one optimized for desktop, one for phones
- It is assumed that you wil be using a CSS framework such as Bootstrap. If so, colors and typefaces must be modified so that the site is not a "cookie cutter" replica of the framework's templates
- Principles of visual design (taught in prerequisite classes) employed: clear visual hierarchy, good use of white space, effective alignment of content, thoughtful choices of colors and visual elements
- Effective typography employed; typeface(s) chosen should be clear and legible as well as appropriate to the content being presented
- The user's initial "landing" on the page should be compelling.
