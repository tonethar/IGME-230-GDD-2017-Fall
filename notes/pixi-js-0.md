# About this PixiJS Tutorial Series
## I. Overview
This series of tutorials/lecture notes will get you started in creating highly visual web experiences with the [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com) rendering engine.

## II. Prerequisite knowledge
Before doing these exercises, you should have completed the entire [web app series](./web-apps-0.md)

## III. How to get the most out of these tutorials
- Try out the code samples! Tweak and modify them! Most of the code samples are 100% complete. You just need to copy the code and paste it into a text file, and save it to your desktop. You can then make changes to the code and preview them in a web browser (we will be using Chrome)
- Be sure to answer all of the questions at the end of each section, and to do the review exercises.
- Check out all of the PixiJS resources, sample code, and demos that we link to.
